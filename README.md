##Introduction

We have used Amazon EC2 to set up remote servers for the deployement pipeline.

**Components**

+ Production Server: Holds the stable version of software
+ Staging Server: Holds the newly staged staged version of software
+ Redis Server: Redis server is run on a seperate instance
+ A java web application that is running inside of a Docker on port 8080

Below is a layout of our setup:

## Tasks

### Automatic configuration of production environment

+ Production and Staging servers were provisioned automatically as done before.
Code can be found in [InstallAuto](https://github.com/sdomir/DevOps_Milestone3/tree/master/InstallAuto)
+ Redis server was set up using Ansible on another EC2 instance.
+ Initial configuration like git and Docker, was configured using Ansible.
+ We have used Docker to deploy our application to the production environment. All the dependencies to run the application were put inside the docker image such that it can be easily deployed anywhere. 

### Triggering remote deployement

+ We are building our application on localhost in response to a git commit. Once the build succeeds, we create a docker image of our application with all the dependecies. This image is then pushed to the docker hub. All this is automated inside the post-commit hook.
+ We have set up a bare git repository on both the production and staging servers.Using a post-recieve hook, the server will pull the docker image from docker hub and spin up a container that runs our application. All this will be triggered in response to a git push.

 **Setting up git repo on servers**
 
 ```
    cd deploy/production.git
    git init --bare
 ```   
 **post-receive hook**
 
 ```
    GIT_WORK_TREE=$ROOT/green-www/ git checkout -f
    docker pull <docker-image>
    docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
    docker run -p 80:80 <docker-image>
 ```

## Metrics and alerts

+ AWS provides us with an easy to use dashboard to set up monitoring using CloudWatch alarms, on EC2 instances.
+ We are monitoring two metrics namely

  **CPU Utilization**
  
  **Network load**
+ We have set thresholds for each metric and set up alerts using emails.

## Autoscaling 
The instances that host the application were made to be a part of teha autoscaling group. AWS provides managed cloud options to define the minimum and maximum size for the number of instances. We defined the rules for maximum and minimum number of instances and CPU utlization parameters to perform scaling. Based on this these configurations AWS will handle scaling up and down of the number of instances in the auto scaling group.

## Feature Flags

+ We have used REDIS server to implement Feature flags in our Application. We are using a Ninja app which uses the MVC framework. So in order to add REDIS client into the application, we modified the original application to start a REDIS client. Since, our app is written in Java, we are using the Lettuce Rdis client to create the client. 

+ As per our architecture, we already deployed an Amazon AWS instance and install and run the redis server inside it using Ansible playbook. This Redis server serves as our central database and all the AWS Instances then connect to this server. We are using a completely different EC2 instance to deploy and run the server

[placeholder image for yaml]

+ We will be using a special key in redis called "flag" to turn features on and off. When the flag value is "0", all the new features will be turned off and no one wil have access to them and accessing a new feature will redirect the user to the main page. However, when flag value is "1", all the new features are turned off and a different page is displayed where the new fetaure is implemented

## Flag value is 0

## Flag value is 1

+ We log into the Server running Redis server and open the redis cli. From the CLI, we control the setting of values of the key "flag". As we can saw, all the new features are deployed only if the flag value is set to true.


## Canary releasing
In our infrastructure setup we have setup two repositories namely production and staging. All pushes can be sent from the local machine to either of the two remote repositries that are setup on the remote AWS instances. This setup will allow new features to be deployed to staging and then to production if stable. Since the instances are a part of an auto scaling group that is being serviced by an elastic application load balancer the traffic will split across the two instances by AWS. We can also setup monitoring on the load balancer and set thresholds. Based on the state of the instances AWS will route traffic between the instances.
